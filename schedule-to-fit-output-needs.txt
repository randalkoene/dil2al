Scheduling tasks to fit output needs:
====================================

(20041110)

The following describes an algorithmic approach to task scheduling that takes
into account the need for a specific measurable output for the total task or
for each cycle of work on tasks.

Sometimes scheduling is simple and you only need to look at the total output
at completion of a task. Sometimes the PERCEIVED OUTPUT during task work is
important.

This results in target dates that produce overlapping times for parallel
work. The overlap and output determine the number of chunks per cycle.

Previously (rescheduling-20040911.txt), three points were made about good
parallel scheduling:
(1) As much as possible, INHERIT target dates.
(2) Retain the order of tasks as desired.
(3) Place target dates further than their absolute minimum, e.g. by setting
    a later virtual date while generating suggested target dates with the
    EPS method.

Also:
- Figure out the LOAD of each task.
- Figure out the PRIORITY of each task.
- Figure out how much room to leave for other stuff (don't move ahead too far).

The LOAD and PRIORITY are involved in the determination of the RATIO OF CHUNKS
PER CYCLE to allocate for a task. And that in turn determines a target date.

The actual significance of COMPLETED output can differ for different tasks.
The RATIO OF CHUNKS PER CYCLE depends on (estimated) MEASURABLE OUTPUT PER
CHUNK of work on a task and on the MEASURABLE OUTPUT PER CYCLE desired for
that task.

measurable output per chunk:
This can be estimated for a type of task, and may be expressed as a curve
for changing values as task completion progresses, e.g.

measurable |              ******
output     |           ***      ******
           |          *               ****
           |         *                    *****
           |       **                          **
           |     **
           |  ***
           |**
         --+------------------------------------>
           | 0%          completion          100%

The total output is the integral of the curve shown above.
